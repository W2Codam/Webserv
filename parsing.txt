1. check domain and compare against all server names. if found, use that server. if not, use first server from config
2. check requested path and compare it against all locations defined in server found in step 1
3. apply each of the location's configurations based on the directory level they are found in



EXAMPLE:

config:
see examples/configs/parsing.ini

GET request to: http://www.extensivepig1.com/subdir/help/parsing/test.html

steps it will take:
1. search for server with name www.extensivepig.1 and apply its config to request's section
2. search for location config for /subdir and apply
3. search for location config for /subdir/help and apply
4. search for location config for /subdir/help/parsing, not found, do nothing
5. search for location config for /subdir/help/parsing/test.html and apply
6. look at resulting config: methods allowed = POST, redir to index.html with 302, but we sent a GET method, so we reply with 405 Method Not Allowed. Easy.
